Question 2 Importing Trashwheel and modifying Mr.Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
trash_df <- read_excel(
 "202509 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
 sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
 range = "A2:N709",
 na = c("NA", ".", "")
) |>
 janitor::clean_names() |>
 mutate(
 table = "mr.trash wheel", 
 sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)),
 year = as.numeric(year)
) |>
 select (dumpster, month, year, date, table, everything())
```

Importing Trashwheel and modifying Professor Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
proff_df <- read_excel(
 "202509 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
 sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
 range = "A2:M134",
 na = c("NA", ".", "")
) |>
 janitor::clean_names() |>
 mutate(
 table = "professor trash wheel"
 ) |>
select (dumpster, month, year, date, table, everything())
```

Importing Trashwheel and modifying Gwynns Falls Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
gwynns_df <- read_excel(
 "202509 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
 sheet = "Gwynns Falls Trash Wheel",
 range = "A2:L351",
 na = c("NA", ".", "")
) |>
 janitor::clean_names() |>
 mutate(
 table = "gwynns falls trash wheel"
 ) |>
select (dumpster, month, year, date, table, everything())
```

Combining the tables

``` r
trash_tidy=
  bind_rows(trash_df, proff_df, gwynns_df)
```

The combined Trash Wheel dataset includes 1188 observations across the
three trash wheels (Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynns
Falls Trash Wheel). Each row corresponds to a dumpster load of trash,
with key variables such as the date of collection (`date`), the total
weight in tons (`weight_tons`), and counts of specific items like
plastic bottles (`plastic_bottles`), cigarette butts
(`cigarette_butts`), and sports balls (`sports_balls`). For example, the
total weight of trash collected by **Professor Trash Wheel** is 282.26
tons. In contrast, **Gwynns Falls Trash Wheel** collected 18120
cigarette butts in June 2022 alone. These summaries highlight both the
scale of debris removed and the variation in composition across trash
wheels and time.

Question 3

Importing Zip codes csv

``` r
library(tidyverse)
zips_df=
  read_csv("Zip Codes.csv", na = c("NA", ".", ""))|>
 janitor::clean_names() |>
mutate(
    zip_code = as.numeric(zip_code),
    county   = county |> stringr::str_to_lower() |> gsub("county", "", x = _) |> stringr::str_squish(),
    county = case_when(
      zip_code == "11693" ~ "queens",
      zip_code == "11201" ~ "kings",
      TRUE ~ county
    )
  ) |> 
select(county, zip_code, neighborhood, everything())|>
relocate (zip_code, county)
```

Importing Zip zori csv

``` r
library(tidyverse)
zori_df=
  read_csv("Zip_zori_uc_sfrcondomfr_sm_month_NYC.csv", na = c("NA", ".", ""))|>
 janitor::clean_names() |>
select (-region_type, -state_name, -state,-city)|>
  rename(zip_code=region_name,county=county_name)|>
  pivot_longer(
    cols=x2015_01_31:x2024_08_31,
    names_to="date",
    values_to="price"
  )|>
 mutate (
    county = str_to_lower(county),       
    county = gsub("county", "", county), 
    date = gsub("x","", date),
      date   = as.Date(sub("^x", "", date), format = "%Y_%m_%d"),
    county = str_squish(county),
    price= as.numeric(price)  
  ) |>
  arrange(price) |>
  relocate (zip_code, county, price, date)
```

combine the two datasets using leftjoin

``` r
zorizip_tidy <- 
  left_join(
    zori_df,
    zips_df,
    by = c("zip_code", "county"),          
    relationship = "many-to-many"        
  ) |>
  relocate(zip_code, county, neighborhood, price, date)
```

The zorizip_tidy dataset, we can track rent trends over time within each
zipcode, county and neighbourhood. The combined zorizip_tidy dataset
includes 17400 observations. Each row corresponds to a particular ZIP
code at a specific date, with key variables including the observed rent
index (`price`), geographic identifiers (e.g. `zip_code`, `county`,
`neighborhood`), and data such as the `file_date` of the ZIP metadata.
The number of unique ZIP codes is 149,and there are 42 unique
neighborhoods. There are 171 ZIP codes that appear in the ZIP data but
not in the Zillow rent file; e.g., 10008, 10020, 10041, 10043, 10045.
ZIP code 10008 is essentially a PO Box / special-use ZIP. Reason why
these ZIP codes might be excluded from the zillow dataset is because the
ZIP code may contain financial areas or parks which may not have homes
or houses to search from.

``` r
merge_table <-
  zorizip_tidy |>
  mutate(
    year  = as.integer(year(date)),
    month = as.integer(month(date))
  ) |>
group_by(zip_code, county, neighborhood, year, month) |>
  filter(!all(is.na(price))) |>
   summarise(price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")|>
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = c(zip_code, county, neighborhood, month),  
    names_from = year,                                      
    values_from = price,
    names_sort = TRUE
  )|>
filter(month == 1) |>
  mutate(price_diff = `2021` - `2020`) |>
  arrange(price_diff) |>           
arrange(price_diff) |> 
  head(10)|>
  rename(borough=)|>
  select(zip_code, county, neighborhood, month, `2020`, `2021`, price_diff)
```
